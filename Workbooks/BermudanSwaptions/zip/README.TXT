This directory is for packaging up the demo into a zip file
which may be deployed outside the source code tree.

To generate the zip, open a DOS prompt in the parent directory
and invoke batch file make_zip.bat.

In this directory, the files README.INSTALLED.TXT and
init.INSTALLED.bat get added to the zip (with the "INSTALLED."
part removed from their names).
